# Mortgage-Remediation-CaseStudy

#Problem Background
The Vice President of RESL at DMX Bank had a meeting with the Vice President of Operations to review F2016 mortgage performance. The analysis of preliminary data seems to reveal that at least 1% of mortgage clients were delinquent as of the end of F2016. Some of those mortgage clients are also holding other products (i.e. credit cards). At this time, they are focused on delinquency rates for new mortgage clients, risk of attrition at several levels (i.e. origination, loan term, province & age segment).

#Situation
You are an Analyst for DMX Bank and have received an e-mail from the Vice President of RESP and the Vice President of Operations asking you to meet and discuss their initial findings, validate the data and to potentially create an analytical tool to help monitor mortgage delinquency rates and its implications on other products.
